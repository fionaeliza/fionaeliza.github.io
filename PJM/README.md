<h2>PJM Data Analyst Projects</h2>

This project includes cleaning up a large timeseries data set using timestamps and Pandas, then adding to holiday and temperature data. Then it takes a look at how we consume electricity using Seaborn with regards to holidays and temperature. It also provides a SARIMA model that can be used to predict future electrical consumption.

If you would like to run my code in a python environment, connected to Kaggle data sets, I have my kaggle profile as linked.
